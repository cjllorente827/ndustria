# Main features (WIP)

* Simple multiprocess parallelization of arbitrary python code
* Dynamic load balancing
* Caching and reuse of intermediate data products
* Association of code and parameters with data, which updates whenever code updates
* Ease of use and understanding. Designed to work with minimal modification to existing code.
